  habits to the @radioandtvbot account 
  on twitter.com. You can optionally 
  provide your twitter username and 
  this will be in the tweet otherwise 
  your Mac login fullname will
  be used. There are growl notifications
  for this. The App will only tweet if you
  have been listening to the same show
  for over 5 mins
* The red close button now displayed. 
  It will quit the App
* The title in the window is now more
  useful, displaying what show you are 
  listening to. Especially useful when 
  the app is zoomed.
* The schedule stays up-to-date. This means
  that when the shows change and become 
  available to listen again, the app knows.
  It also means that the title and tweeting
  happens as you listen throughout the day.
