*1.5.0* (Mar 26th, 2009)

* the schedule menu has been updated to
  correctly display what broadcast you are
  listening to, live or listen again. Also 
  if you are listening to a show again 
  the schedule will indicate this as well 
  as letting you see and select what is 
  currently playing live on that particular 
  network
* keeping the app always on top can now 
  be done via the preferences menu
* Now using the shared BBCProgrammes libs

*1.4.0* (Mar 22st, 2009)

* New icon. Thanks to David Wilson
  Not only new, but animated too. I spent
  far too long making this cool, but I 
  think it was worth it
* Twitter support. Via the preferences menu
  You can now choose to post your listening 
  habits to the @radioandtvbot account 
  on twitter.com. You can optionally 
  provide your twitter username and 
  this will be in the tweet otherwise 
  your Mac login fullname will
  be used. There are growl notifications
  for this. The App will only tweet if you
  have been listening to the same show
  for over 5 mins
* The red close button now displayed. 
  It will quit the App
* The title in the window is now more
  useful, displaying what show you are 
  listening to. Especially useful when 
  the app is zoomed.
* The schedule stays up-to-date. This means
  that when the shows change and become 
  available to listen again, the app knows.
  It also means that the title and tweeting
  happens as you listen throughout the day.

*1.3.0* (Feb 23rd, 2009)
